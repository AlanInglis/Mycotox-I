# Mycotox-I

This repository contains code used in the **Mycotox-I** project, which focuses on using deep and transfer learning methods to predict mycotoxin
presence and level in Irish cereal crops.

The scripts and workflows here support the development, testing, and evaluation of machine learning models applied to multi-response prediction tasks involving environmental, agronomic, and geographical data.  

## Contents
